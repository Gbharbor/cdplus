#include <iostream> // Includes the standard input-output library, necessary to use 'cout' and 'cin'.

using namespace std; // Allows you to use elements from the C++ standard library without needing to write 'std::' before them.

int main() { // Main function of the program, where execution begins. 'int' indicates that it will return an integer value.

    cout << "Hello world" << endl << "Hello again"; // Sends the message "Hello world" to the screen, followed by a new line, and then "Hello again".
    // 'cout' is used to display text on the screen.
    // '<<' is the insertion operator that directs the text to 'cout'.
    // 'endl' is a manipulator that creates a new line in the console.

    return 0; // Ends the 'main' function and returns 0 to indicate that the program finished successfully.
